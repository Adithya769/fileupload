        <p class="par">Many festivals have religious origins and entwine cultural and religious significance in traditional activities. 
            The most important religious festivals such as Christmas, Rosh Hashanah, Diwali, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha serve to mark out the year. Others, such as harvest festivals, celebrate seasonal change. Events of historical significance, such as important military victories or other nation-building events also provide the impetus for a festival. 
            An early example is the festival established by Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses III celebrating his victory over the Libyans</p>
